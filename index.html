        <p>More developed regions tend show higher importation rates of wild animals such as North America, 
            Europe and Australia which may be more expensive to import compared to 
            captive animals.

        A larger portion of African countries had no export records, indicating that either they do not
        export wild or captive animals, or the records were not registered with the CITES organisation.

        largest number of records, with the Sauria order being 85% traded from the wild but the Serpentes
        order consisted of 42% of wild animals being traded. Interestingly, records of python bivittatus species
        showed only 8% were wild animals, the large majority being captive.

    <div class="text-left">There was an overwhlemingly larger portion of detrimental species being traded compared
        to beneficial species, perhaps they are more wanted species. The proportion of wild and captive species is quite
        even between both protection levels, and wild beneficial species being traded more often compared to captive.

    <div class="text-right"><p>A large majority of the purpose for trading was commercial, with a total of 13,883
        records, with roughly equal captive and wild animals. </p>
        <p>Majority of records for medical and 
        zoo purposes were captive animals. Whereas trading animals for educational, hunting trophies and

    <div class="text-left"><p>The condition or part of animal that was traded varies greatly. The largest condition
        traded was live animals, with 8,236 records, followed by small leather products with 4,280 records.
        For live animals, 68% were captive animals whereas for small leather products, only 35% were captive.</p>
        <p>Although it appears there are more wild animal records, there are just more conditions that only consisted
