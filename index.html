        <p>More developed regions tend show higher importation rates of wild animals such as North America, 
            Europe and Australia which may be more expensive to import compared to 
            captive animals.

        A larger portion of African countries had no export records, indicating that either they do not
        export wild or captive animals, or the records were not registered with the CITES organisation.
