    <div class="paragraph"><p>The importation of <span class="light">captive</span> and <span class="dark">wild</span> animals globally.</p>
        <p>Majority of countries import a relatively equal amount of <span class="dark">wild</span> and <span class="light">captive</span> 
        animals. Africa shows more countries importing <span class="light">captive</span> animals comapred to <span class="dark">wild</span>.</p>
        
        <p>More developed regions tend show higher importation rates of <span class="dark">wild</span> animals such as North America, 
            Europe and Australia which may be more expensive to import compared to 
            <span class="light">captive</span> animals.

        <p>Majority of Europe exports more <span class="light">captive</span> animals than <span class="dark">wild</span> animals. Most of
        North and South America export mainly <span class="dark">wild</span> animals. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A larger portion of African countries had no export records, indicating that either they do not
        export <span class="dark">wild</span> or <span class="light">captive</span> animals, or the records were not registered with the CITES organisation.

        <p>The Aves class (birds) and all orders, genuses, families, and species that stem from it
        are mainly captive animals whereas the Mammalia class consists of 90% of <span class="dark">wild</span> animals.</p>
        <p>Whereas the Reptilia class has the
        largest number of records, with the Sauria order being 85% traded from the <span class="dark">wild</span> but the Serpentes
        order consisted of 42% of <span class="dark">wild</span> animals being traded. Interestingly, records of python bivittatus species
        showed only 8% were <span class="dark">wild</span> animals, the large majority being <span class="light">captive</span>.</p>

        <p>The proportion of <span class="dark">wild</span> and <span class="light">captive</span> species is quite
        even between both protection levels, and <span class="dark">wild</span> beneficial species being traded more often compared to <span class="light">captive</span>.</p>
        <p>There was an overwhlemingly larger portion of detrimental species being traded compared
            to beneficial species, perhaps they are more wanted species. </p>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>The purpose for exporting or importing the animal varies between commerical and personal reasons.</p>
        <p>A large majority of the purpose for trading was commercial, with a total of 13,883
        records, with roughly equal <span class="light">captive</span> and <span class="dark">wild</span> animals. </p>
        <p>Majority of records for medical and 
        zoo purposes were <span class="light">captive</span> animals. Whereas trading animals for educational, hunting trophies and
        scientific purposes mainly consisted of <span class="dark">wild</span> animals. </p>

        <p>The condition or part of animal that was traded varies greatly. The largest condition
        traded was live animals, with 8,236 records, followed by small leather products with 4,280 records.
        For live animals, 68% were <span class="light">captive</span> animals whereas for small leather products, only 35% were <span class="light">captive</span>.</p>
        <p>Although it appears there are more <span class="dark">wild</span> animal records, there are just more conditions that only consisted
        of a small number of <span class="dark">wild</span> animals, such as horns and fur products.</p>
